This prototype of message board cosnsists of client and server. Frontend is developed with React with vite.js and backend with Express.js. Whole implementation is coded with TypeScript.

Features:
- User can view and access to all channels that exist by default
- User can view the messages on the specific channel
- User can submit new messages to the specific channel

Requirements have been carefully followed. Please, notice that for example, editor panel is hidden is channel is not selected or submit button is disabled if textfield input is empty.

This application includes a very little error handling as well, however not nearly as much as it would require.
